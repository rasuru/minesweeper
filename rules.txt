- Clicked cell is revealed
- When all unrevealed cells are mines,
  the game is won
- When clicked cell is a mine, the game
  is lost
- A board is built like this:
    - Each cell's neighbour mines count
      starts with 0
    - Mines are planted
    - When a mine is planted, all of it's
      neighbours' mine counters increase
    - Then safe cells are built
    - When a safe cell is built and it's
      neighbour mines count is still 0,
      all of the neighbours are revealed
- A board is generated like this:
    - You can specify the amount of
      mines (N)
    - First N cells are mines, others
      are safe
    - The board is shuffled
    - If first click lands on a mine, it
      becomes a safe cell
- Cell can tell:
    - If it is a mine
    - If it is revealed or not
    - It's neighbour mines count
    - It's row
    - It's column
